Hereâ€™s a breakdown of the key steps:
ðŸ”¹ Data Preprocessing: Started with the UCI Heart Disease dataset, which required significant cleaning, including handling hundreds of duplicate entries.
ðŸ”¹ Feature Engineering: Correctly handled categorical data (like chest pain type) using one-hot encoding, which was crucial for improving model performance.
ðŸ”¹ Model Building & Tuning: Trained and compared multiple models.
ðŸ”¹ Deployment: To bring the model to life, I built an interactive web application using Streamlit. Users can input a patient's medical data and get a real-time prediction.
